                Surya Namaskar serves as a great practice to manage psychosomatic ailments such as Diabetes and reduce
                the risk for Heart Disease. Surya Namaskar or Sun Salutation is a sequence of 12 powerful yoga poses.
                Besides being a great cardiovascular workout, Surya Namaskar is also known to have an immensely positive
                impact on the body and mind. Practicing Surya Namaskar steps is best done early morning on an empty
                stomach. Each round of Sun Salutation consists of two sets, and each set is composed of 12 yoga poses.
                You might find several versions on how to practice Sun Salutation. However, it is advisable to stick to
                one particular version and practice it regularly for the best results. Besides good health, Surya
                Namaskar also provides an opportunity to express gratitude to the sun for sustaining life on this
                planet.
