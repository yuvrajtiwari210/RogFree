                    Yoga is a powerful practice that helps us stay active, manage stress, and also help with pain management. Yoga helps because of its strong focus on breathing, which energizes and relaxes our nervous system. Secondly, we move in so many different ways and planes of motion in a yoga class that it works like a complete reset for our posture. And a good posture means less pain. That's why a wholesome yoga practice with a wide variety of poses and mindful breathing helps reduce chronic pain and stiffness in muscles or joints. Here are eight strengthening and stretching postures that are particularly helpful in managing pain in the most common areas of the body.
