        <div class="asanasubtitle">By providing a conscious opening in the chest and stretch in the shoulders, Cobra Pose, called Bhujangasana in Sanskrit, fights fatigue and relieves lower back pain, boosting both the energetic and the physical body.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div id="intro">Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose) is a heart-opening backbend that stretches your entire upper body and can provide relief if you’re experiencing back pain, tightness in your shoulders, or upper body soreness. <br> <br>
        Move into this pose slowly in order to avoid straining your back, notes yoga teacher Abbie Mood. If you are coming into this pose from Sphinx Pose, Mood says you should avoid pushing your ribs forward. Instead, ensure that the backbend is evenly distributed throughout your spine. Your upper back is harder to bend than your lower back. To open it, think of lengthening your spine to make more space between the vertebrae.

            <p class="asanadesc">If you're in the middle of a Sun Salutation, you'll be coming into Cobra from Knees, Chest, and Chin. If not, you can begin by lying down flat on your stomach.<ol><li>Place your palms flat on the ground directly under your shoulders. Bend your elbows straight back and hug them into your sides.</li>
            <li>Pause for a moment looking straight down at your mat with your neck in a neutral position. Anchor your pubic bone to the floor.</li>
            <li>Inhale to lift your chest off the floor. Roll your shoulders back and keep your low ribs on the floor. Make sure your elbows continue hugging your sides. Don't let them wing out to either side.</li>
            <li>Keep your neck neutral. Don’t crank it up. Your gaze should stay on the floor.</li>
            <li>Exhale to release back to the floor (or push back to Downward Facing Dog, Adho Mukha Svanasana, if you are doing a Sun Salutation).</li>
            </ol></p> <br> <br></div>

            
            <p class="asanadesc">Cobra Pose should not be done if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or an injury to your back, arms, or shoulders. Also, avoid it if you recently had abdominal surgery or are pregnant. <br>
            If you feel any strain on your lower back, relax the pose to lower yourself a bit, or release down to rest on your forearms.</p>
